first:
    construct an map, whose key is the element of the array,
    and the value is the list of the element's location (start from zero) where the element is placed.
second: 
    violent traversal the map to find the result
    sorted the map to make the most likely result being first discovered
    random search
        first the result must meet the request that the number of its index is larger or equal than threshold
        second the distance of the most left and  the most right index is larger or equal threshold
