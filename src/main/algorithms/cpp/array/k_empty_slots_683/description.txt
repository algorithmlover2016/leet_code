You have N bulbs in a row numbered from 1 to N. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.
    We turn on exactly one bulb everyday until all bulbs are on after N days.

You are given an array bulbs of length N where bulbs[i] = x means that on the (i+1)th day,
    we will turn on the bulb at position x where i is 0-indexed and x is 1-indexed.

Given an integer K, find out the minimum day number such that there exists two turned on bulbs
    that have exactly K bulbs between them that are all turned off.

If there isn't such day, return -1.

Example 1:
    Input: 
        bulbs: [1,3,2]
        K: 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
        On the first day: bulbs[0] = 1, first bulb is turned on: [1,0,0]
        On the second day: bulbs[1] = 3, third bulb is turned on: [1,0,1]
        On the third day: bulbs[2] = 2, second bulb is turned on: [1,1,1]
        We return 2 because on the second day, there were two on bulbs with one off bulb between them.

Example 2:
    Input: 
        bulbs: [1,2,3]
        K: 1
    Output: -1

Note:
    1 <= N <= 20000
    1 <= bulbs[i] <= N
    bulbs is a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.
    0 <= K <= 20000

or description as follow:

There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days.
    In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.

Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the
    flower will open in that day.

For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and x
    will be in the range from 1 to N.

Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming,
    and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.

If there isnâ€™t such day, output -1.

Example 1:
    Input:
        flowers: [1,3,2]
        k: 1
    Output: 2
        Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.

Example 2:
    Input:
        flowers: [1,2,3]
        k: 1
    Output: -1

Note:
        The given array will be in the range [1, 20000].
