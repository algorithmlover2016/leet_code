at first, we add nums.size()(namely, K) elements, then if there is only one column, the range is (max - min);
when we add a new element, the new element must be larger than the min, so we need to remove the min, but add which element?
every time, we make sure that the size of min priority_queue is equal to K; so to make sure we get the right answer,
        we must add the same row in nums, which row we just remove the min element, so we need remember the row index;
        and we must add the next element. which meas we need remember the col index.
        To get the min diff, each time we add a element, we need update the max;
