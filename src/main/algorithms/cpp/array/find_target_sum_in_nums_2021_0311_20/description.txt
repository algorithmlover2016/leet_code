Given a array nums (unique elements), and a number target, find two elements whose sum is target
return the index of the two elements.
Example:
    Input: nums = [2, 7, 9, 10], target = 9;
    Output: {0, 1}
    Explanation:
        9 = 9, there is only one element whose sum is 9;
        2 + 7 = 9, so we return {0, 1}
    
Note:
    Assuming that the result will always exists
