if we want to do get put operation in O(1) time complexity, we should use map
insert in O(1) time complexity, should use linked_list
first, we use map to storage key and linked node and the linked node record the value
    map get its value by key is O(1) time complexity, and the linked node recording the value
second, we should modify the storage, so we need insert or delete elements.
    If we want do it in O(1) time complexity, we should use list
